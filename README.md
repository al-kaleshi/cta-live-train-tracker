<h1 align="center">CTA Live Train Tracker</h1>

<p>
    CTA Live Train Tracker is an app that communicates with CTA's public API, it then recieves a large JSON object of different information about each train currently running. I then pull the data I need and inject the data into a script that will place markers of where each train is located as the API updates every ten seconds. The map and markers are created using google maps API.
